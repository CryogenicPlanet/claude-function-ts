# claude-tc

Typescript claude tool calling library

Opus and haiku are great and I think anthropic function calling syntax is interesting (allows for better chain of thought and json schema is kinda bad for models to understand dense schemas tho it seems token intensive and could def have problems of it's own)

## Usage (with Anthropic sdk)

```ts
```

## Usage (with Openai sdk)

```ts
```
